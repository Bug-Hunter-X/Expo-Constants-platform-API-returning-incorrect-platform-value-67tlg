This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device information.  The `Constants.platform` property sometimes returns an unexpected value, especially on Android emulators or devices running older versions of Android. This leads to conditional logic based on platform checks failing. For instance, a check like `if (Constants.platform === 'ios') { ... }` might incorrectly execute on an Android device.
